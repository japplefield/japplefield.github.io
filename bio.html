        Hello! My name is Justin. I am an aspiring
        creator from West Bloomfield, Michigan.
      </p>
      <p>
        I graduated in 2018 from Cranbrook Kingswood, and am currently a
        sophomore at the University of Michigan, where I am studying Computer
        Science in the College of Engineering, Business Adminstration in the
        Ross School of Business, and Mandarin Chinese. I plan to pursue a
        Bachelor of Science in Engineering and Bachelor of Business
        Administration dual degree. At Michigan, I am currently involved with
        Kol HaKavod Acapella, serving as the Musical Director, and with TAMID
        Group, an organization that aims to cultivate business leaders with
        experiential learning through business in Israel, serving as the
        Co-Director of Marketing for the Michigan Chapter.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have had the opportunity to work on a few cool projects in the past
        couple of years. In June 2017, I developed a curriculum to foster
        interest in the English language among 3rd-5th graders, and traveled
        with peers to Guiyang No. 4 Experimental Primary School in Guiyang,
        Guizhou, China as part of an inaugural English teaching exchange program.
        In April 2018 I was an emcee at the VEX Robotics World
        Championship in Louisville, Kentucky, calling matches for the Spirit
        Division. In May 2018 I worked with the Cranbrook Kingswood
        Science Department and MIT's Internet of Things Lab to design a
        curriculum to teach 9th grade physics students about the Internet of
        Things with a hands-on project. In July-August 2018 I traveled to 7
        countries in Asia over a 28 day period and produced a vlog every single
        day. In Fall 2018 I led the development team of "Metro Master," a game
        designed to help visually impaired students get comfortable with
        navigational skills, which was produced for "Gaming for the Greater
        Good," an introductory Computer Science class at the University of
        Michigan.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you can probably tell, I have a wide array of interests including
        music, international business, and technology. If you want to collaborate
        on a project or just to chat, feel free to contact me at:
