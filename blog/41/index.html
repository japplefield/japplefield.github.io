        Sydney Part 2: The Beaches

          I started the day off nice and early by walking through the Surry Hills neighborhood east of my hostel to go get breakfast from Bill's, which is famous for their scrambled eggs and ricotta-honey pancakes. I opted for the Full Aussie breakfast, which had scrambeled eggs, toast, sausage, bacon, and tomatoes. The scrambled eggs were very good, and the rest of the breakfast was fine, but I don't think it is deserving of the hype.

          After breakfast I took a bus to Bondi Beach, located east of Sydney right on the Pacific Ocean. Bondi Beach is probably the most famous beach in Australia, although early in the morning it wasn't too crowded. My plan for the morning was to walk along the coast from Bondi Beach to Coogee Beach, located a few kilometers south. There were plenty of other people doing the same walk.

          The walk is incredibly beautiful, as it goes up and down the cliffs that line the coast between various beaches. The cliffs aren't sheer, instead they show evidence of lots of interesting erosion patterns, which keeps the walk interesting. The internet says to allow 2.5-4 hours for the walk, but it took me less than 2 hours to walk all the way to Coogee Beach.

          Before heading back to Sydney, I took my shoes off and waded in the water. It was a lot colder than I had expected. Then I stopped at a juice shop near the beach to grab a post-walk snack, before hopping on a bus to head back to central Sydney.

          By the time I got back to the city, it was lunchtime, so I walked to Marrickville Pork Roll, a Banh Mi shop with a location in Haymarket near my hostel. I wanted to order a BBQ Pork Banh Mi, but they were sold out, so I settled for the regular pork version. It was really good, but I found it really hard to eat without making a mess.

          After eating I planned to spend a couple hours Facetiming Christine for Valentine's Day (it was still February 14th back home), but the wifi at my hostel was unbearably slow, so I took a bus to Starbucks to use the wifi there. The wifi wasn't too great at Starbucks either, there was a lot of background noise, and I forgot to bring my international plug adapter with me, so I had to use my power bank to charge my laptop. But I made it work, and we got to spend a couple of hours hanging out, talking, and playing Wingspan together online, which was really nice.

          After our virtual date, I went to get sushi at Edomae Sushi Yokocho in the basement of a mall in central Sydney, since Christine and I decided it would be fun if we both ate the same thing to celebrate Valentine's Day.

          After dinner, I decided I would go see the new Ant-Man Quantumania movie in the theater, since it was premiering today (despite it still being February 14 in the US, and the premiere not being until February 16 in the US, for some reason Australia gets the movie early). The theater I planned to go to was closed due to a power outage, so I had to go to one a bit further from my hostel. When I got there, I used the automated machine to buy a ticket, but it didn't print a receipt or a ticket, so I had to spend a few minutes talking to the manager to prove I bought a ticket, and figure out what my seat was. Luckily it was pretty late so the theater wasn't too full. The movie was fun to watch but the pacing felt a little too fast, which I guess is par for the course with Marvel movies these days.
