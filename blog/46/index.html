        Great Barrier Reef Part 3: Fish Identification

          We woke up an hour earlier than yesterday so we could get in three dives before lunch time. For our first dive we wanted to be in the water by 6:30am, just as the sun was rising. This would be the final certification dive for the Advanced Open Water certification, and my buddy was Sara again. It was the Fish Identification dive, and we went down unguided, with the objective of being able to tell Veronica the names of at least five fish that we saw when we got back to the boat. We were diving in a different dive site on Flynn Reef called Little Tracy. There were a few hiccups getting my gear ready as my tank wasn't refilling, and my computer battery was low, so we got in the water a few minutes after we would have liked, so the dive would have to be a bit short. I thought fish identification would be difficult because I had been really bad at knowing the names of fish, but it was easier than I thought. We saw: bicolor angelfish, pencilled surgeonfish, harlequin tuskfish, bumphead parrotfish, humbug, green turtles, surf parrotfish, coral cod, and some unknown type of jellyfish.

          For the second dive of the day, I went with Sara and Karen as a group of three. We went in a different dive site at Flynn Reef called Coral Gardens. Instead of exploring the "garden" section of the site, we started by descending along a large wall where we saw lots of parrotfish. We then went up the wall into the coral gardens which were absolutely beautiful: there was barely any empty dirt, it was all full of coral.

          At this point I had done ten dives and my ear was bothering me a lot, so I decided I wouldn't go on the eleventh and final dive, and I went snorkeling instead with Alex and Patricia, two doctors from Spain. We were still at Coral Gardens which was a great site to go snorkeling at because it is so shallow and there is so much coral and fish to see near the surface. We even saw a green sea turtle, but my camera had somehow fogged up for the first time so I wasn't able to get a good photo of it.

          By 11:45am everyone had to be back on the ship. We had lunch and started sailing back for Cairns. I went down to my cabin and took a nap until 2:30pm when we were called up to the saloon for a final briefing from Ethan. He invited us all to meet for dinner together in Cairns that night. The boat arrived at Cairns around 3:30pm and we returned to the dive shop to check out, before we were transported back to our hotels. I checked back in at Traveller's Oasis, coincidentally to the same room I had been staying in before. I took the time to do laundry and sew a button back onto my pants that had fallen off, and I facetimed Christine. While I was sitting there, Gal and Ori arrived, which was a funny coincidence. And not too long after, Zach also arrived. The four of us hung out and had some beer before deciding to all walk together to Rattle n Hum around 7:30pm.

          I was very hungry by the time we got to Rattle n Hum so I quickly ordered some food. I had a BBQ Chicken Pizza that was pretty good, but I was also very hungry so that could manipulate my taste buds a bit in this case. I got a chance to talk to some people I hadn't talked to much on the boat: two Danish girls and two Danish guys who were probably close to my age, a Canadian guy named Greg who had just got to Australia for working holiday, and three Sri Lankan guys ("Team Sri Lanka"), two who live in Melbourne and one who works on a cargo ship who was visiting them. After sitting around for a while, we were encouraged to walk down to the waterfront to Salt House, a bar/club that served $5 drinks on Monday nights. I went with the group, but only stayed for a couple of minutes because it wasn't my vibe.
