          On my last full day in Melbourne I got to sleep in a little before heading out. The first thing I wanted to do was visit Mork Chocolate Brew House, a specialty hot chocolatier with a shop northwest of the Melbourne CBD. I headed to the tram station and then realized that the next tram arriving would be Tram 35, the City Circle Tram, which makes a loop of the Melbourne CBD and narrates what you are passing, so I decided to hop on that and take it around the long way. I wasn't aware that there was some construction and eventually the "City Circle" tram made a u-turn and started heading back the other way, so I wasn't able to make the complete journey around the city.

        <div class="blog-paragraph">
          After that detour I made it to Mork where I ordered the Campfire Hot Chocolate which the staff recommended. They first roasted a marshmallow with a blowtorch, then they had a smoker filled with maple woodchips and they blew smoke into the hot chocolate and covered it with a stone to let it absorb the smoky flavor. The finished product was a mix of sweet, rich, smoky, and salty, which was a really interesting combination, but I'm not sure it can beat the hot chocolate we had in Turkey.

        <div class="blog-paragraph">
          After the hot chocolate I headed to the opposite side of the city to the Melbourne Botanic Garden. I took the tram to the Shrine of Remembrance station and visited that first. The Shrine of Remembrance is a large war memorial, originally built for WWI, but it now honors Australians who served in any war. There are galleries inside displaying a variety of medals and other military memorabilia.

          I then walked across the street to the Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria. It happened that today they were hosting the Great Local Picnic, which is an event sponsored by the National Sustainable Living Festival, where a variety of speakers came to discuss sustainable living. There was a huge group of people sitting on the lawn, eating, and listening to the speakers. In another section of the garden I ended up overhearing some people making toasts at a wedding, although I wasn't actually able to see the wedding which was taking place on the other side of some tall hedges. The garden is very large and features some interesting subsections such as Guilfoyles Volcano and the Arid Garden, both of which have an emphasis on succulents.

          Just outside of the Botanic Gardens, down St Kilda Road, lies a large Floral Clock, which is a memorial to Edward VII. I noticed it on the tram ride down to the garden, and walked past it on my way back to the city.

        <div class="blog-paragraph">
          Across from the Floral Clock and outside the Art Gallery there were some vendors hosting a kind of Sunday art market on the sidewalk. I walked down St Kilda Road until I made it back to the Melbourne CBD. I continued walking through a couple of artsy shopping areas such as The Block Arcade, which had a cool dome, and Bourke Street Mall, which is an outdoor shopping street that the tram runs down.

          I next took the tram to the Melbourne Museum. Using my student ID I was able to get in for free, otherwise I'm not sure I would have initially wanted to pay for the entrance ticket. I'm glad I visited because on the ground floor there was a very good exhibit discussing Aboriginal history (I think one of the best I have seen in Australia). One particular fact I learned was that Australia is the only Commonwealth country to have never signed a treaty with its indigenous people: the only thing that came close is Batman's Treaty from 1835 which was declared void by the Governor of New South Wales.

          From the Melbourne Museum, I headed to a nearby neighborhood called Collingwood to walk down Smith Street, which I had read was named the coolest street in the world. I'm not sure what the criteria was for this, but I didn't find anything particular interesting about the street, or any of the shops on it. Maybe Sunday is a less busy day. I was really hungry because I hadn't eaten much, so I stopped at Rock Salt 'n Vinegar to get some fish and chips. They were served with potato cakes and calamari, and this may be the best calamari I've ever had: the pieces were the size of onion rings, but they were really tender and delicious.

          I headed back to my hostel to relax for a bit before I went out for a late dinner. I was not super hungry but Wai Chung had insisted I go to Universal Restaurant to try some Chicken Parm because it is a very tasty and affordable meal, popular among university students. I headed there but there was a huge line down the block and I didn't want to wait. Instead I headed back towards the city center and stopped in David's Master Pot to get some DIY hot pot like I had in Adelaide (which I since learned is actually called malatang, and is a popular †ype of street food in China that I'd never seen during my travels there, probably because I would have been avoiding spicy food). I got ordered mine at 3/4 spice level, expecting it to be not very spicy, but to my surprise, for the first time in Australia I got something that was too spicy for me. Combined with the fact that I wasn't too hungry and was feeling a little nauseous, I regrettably ended up wasting some food.
