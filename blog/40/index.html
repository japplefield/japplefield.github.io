        Sydney Part 1: A Rainy Day

          I planned to be in Sydney for 3 days but had not really planned what to do on those three days, so my priority for the start of the day was to find somewhere to sit and plan out the next three days. I walked a couple blocks away to a coffee shop called 6oz Coffee and sipped on a Flat White while I did some research.

          The weather report said it would be raining for most of the day and be clear for the next two days, so I decided I would try to go to a few museums today. I walked through Chinatown to get to a tram station and boarded a tram heading closer to the center of Sydney

          Along the way I stopped to check out the Queen Victoria Building (or the QVB) which is a historic building that is now a shopping mall.

          After some exploring I made it to the Australian National Maritime Museum located on Darling Harbor. The museum has a general admission section which is free for all visitors, and there are a few additional temporary exhibits and ships you can pay to explore. I decided to only check out the general admissions section, and there were some exhibits about the history of navigation around Australia, and the maritime wildlife in Sydney Harbor.

          After a brief visit at the museum I walked across a bridge to Barangaroo, the precinct on the opposite side of Darling Harbor. It was lunch time so I stopped at Ume Burger, a restaurant serving Japanese-inspired burgers. I had their signature Ume Burger which was very good but nothing that special, a homemade Yuzu Brown Sugar Soda which was really nice, and the house hot chips with umami seasoning, which were amazing.

          While I was eating it started raining really hard, and it was not clear if there was anywhere to walk that was covered, so I was not in much of a hurry to go anywhere. Unfortunately, the Australian Museum, which I planned to go to next, isn't conveniently accessible by trains, and the buses don't come very frequently, so I walked briefly in the rain and took a train to Museum Station, then walked past the Anzac Memorial to get to the Australian Museum. Luckily, there was enough tree coverage that I didn't get completely soaked.

          The Australian Museum had a few great galleries. One was the Gallery of Treasures which contained a wide variety of items that were not specific to Australia. There was another exhibit all about animals with a lot of examples of Australian native animals, including a taxidermy platypus. There was also an exhibit talking about the history of Aboriginal Rights movements.

          I next headed to the Museum of Sydney before it closed. I thought this museum was actually particularly underwhelming. There was an exhibit with lots of photographs of Sydney to show how it evolved over time, and a model of the First Fleet, which is the fleet of ships that first established the Colony of New South Wales. Otherwise, there wasn't much to see at the museum.

          By now the rain had mostly subsided, so I walked from the Museum of Sydney to Circular Quay and The Rocks, where I was able to admire the views of the Sydney Harbor Bridge and the Sydney Opera House, two iconic structures.

          For dinner I wanted to try a couple of places that were listed online as having some of the best inexpensive food in Sydney. I went to Mamak, which had a line out the door down the block, for some Roti Canai, which is a roti served with two different curries and some sambal, and was really delicious. I also went to Emperor's Puffs, which serves Chinese Cream Puffs that are freshly made, which also had a line down the street. Apparently though they've recently doubled their price from 30 cents per puff to 60 cents per puff, and I don't really think it was worth the wait.

          After dinner I wanted to go exploring, but there was very little to explore since things tend to close really early in Australia, and Sydney is not excluded from that. I went to King's Cross, another neighborhood just east of central Sydney, just to check it out, but there was not much to see apart from the iconic Coca-Cola sign.
