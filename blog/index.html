                My time on the South Island was coming to a close. My final objective was to ride the Tranzalpine train, which connects Greymouth on the west coast with Christchurch on the east coast. Many tourists spend the whole day riding the train as a round-trip journey (it departs Christchurch in the morning, takes an hour break in Greymouth, then heads back to Christchurch), but I really only wanted to ride it one-way, so when planning my trip I deliberately started in Christchurch, picked up a car that I'd drop off in Greymouth, then booked a one-way train back to Christchurch and a flight departing the following morning. In order to catch my train, I'd need to drive all the way from Queenstown to Greymouth, which is a seven hour drive. I decided to break this up, so today I'd be driving about 5 hours from Queenstown to Franz Josef, a small town adjacent to Westland Tai Poutini National Park.

                Today I planned to go to Milford Sound, on the coast of the South Island, deep within Fiordland National Park. There is a road from Te Anau to Milford Sound, and Google Maps says it is a two hour drive, but to save myself some driving and because I'd heard the Milford Road could be a bit difficult to drive, I booked a day tour from Te Anau. The tour included a round-trip bus from Te Anau to Milford Sound, a boat cruise in Milford Sound, and a box lunch.

                I originally planned to do the Queenstown Hill Time Walk this morning, which goes straight up a hill behind Queenstown with good views of the town, but I woke up not feeling very well so I decided to do a shorter hike instead. I drove about twenty minutes down the shore of Lake Wakatipu to hike around Bob's Cove, which goes around an inlet of the lake. The hike took about an hour, and finished by climbing up a smaller hill to Picnic Point, which has good views of the cove I had just walked around.

                My plan today was to visit Aoraki / Mount Cook National Park, home to Aoraki (English: Mount Cook), the tallest peak in New Zealand. I woke up early, around 6am, and left just after dawn. It was about an hour drive, mostly along the shore of beautiful Lake Pukaki, before reaching Mount Cook Village inside the park.

                I was not in much of a rush to wake up this morning, as I planned to just see a few things in Christchurch before hitting the road. I set an alarm for 8:30am but was woken up by everyone else in my room waking up even earlier than that: it seems they did not plan on sticking around for long either, as all of them took all their belongings with them. My plan for the morning was to just explore central Christchurch before heading to the Art Gallery, which didn't open until 10am. I parked near the Art Gallery and got a flat white from Lux Espresso, a cute cafe down the street, before heading to the Riverside Market Area. Located next to the Avon River, Riverside Market is a cute area with shops and a food court reminiscent of the Food Market at the V&A Waterfront in Cape Town: basically an up-market food court. When I weas there, not much was open. I got an Almond Croissant at a bakery called Bellbird inside the market.

                I woke up at 4:45am and grabbed the few belongings I bothered to bring inside and headed out to my car. This morning I had booked an excursion to go out into the Pacific and swim with wild dolphins, and I had to be at the store at 5:20am. Upon arrival, I checked in and sat down at a table in the cafe area. After about ten minutes of waiting, one of the guides, Simon, came over and invited a portion of those who signed up to swim to head back into the gear room and get fitted for wet suits and other snorkeling gear. We were all given two-piece wet suits (I think they were 7mm but could have been 9mm) with hoods, masks, snorkels, and fins. I had also brought my GoPro along. After trying on the gear to make sure it fit, we stayed in our wetsuits and headed to the auditorium, where they played beautiful footage of albatrosses and dolphins in the nearby waters. Once everyone was ready, they played a video explaining how the dolphin encounter would work. We would be swimming with wild dolphins, and the dolphins are naturally curious so we may attract their attention, but they aren't trained so they won't stick around if they don't want to.

                I landed on time around 7:30am at Sydney. I had a connecting flight to Melbourne that departed in about 2 hours, and my plan was to then spend the day at the Australian Open in Melbourne. As our plane from Bali was landing they informed us that there was some disease in Indonesia and the Australian government was concerned it would spread to Australia, so we had to walk across some mats that had been soaked in a pesticide as we got off the plane. Then, there was an automated kiosk that arriving passengers had to use. One of the questions was "Have you been to Indonesia in the past 7 days" to which I answered yes, and then the machine immediately spit out a ticket that you had to take with you to present to the customs officer later on. I used the smart gate for immigration, and then because I had no checked luggage, proceeded right to customs. I haded my immigration form and ticket ot the customs officer, who sent me through on my way; I'm not sure if there was meant to be any extra screening since I came from Indonesia, but obviously the officer didn't really care.

                I had one final day in Bali, with a flight to Australia departing from Denpasar at 10:30pm. I did not have a real plan, but the weather outside looked really nice and I was a few days behind on blog posts, so I wanted to find a couple of cool cafes to do some work and take some time walking around the rice terraces. I left my large backpack at the front desk at my hotel, but brought my laptop with me in my small backpack, and set out for the day. The first cafe I went to was called The Suku and was located less than ten minutes walk from Pulu Sari Suites.

                I woke up nice and early at 5:30am and packed my bags to get ready for a day of diving. The dive trip was arranged through Adventure Scuba Diving Bali (ASDB), a highly rated dive shop on the island. They emailed me the night before letting me know I would be picked up at 7:10am, but because of the traffic in the Ubud area this ended up being closer to 7:20am. I got in the car and met Chad, who is an instructor at ASDB and who would be diving with me today. It was a 2.5 hour drive from my hotel to Tulamben Bay where we would be diving. Chad slept the whole time.

              Siem Reap Part 2: Angkor What? Khmer Who?

                Today I planned to go to Angkor Wat. In order to watch the sunrise, I had arranged with the hotel for a driver and a tour guide to meet and leave at 5am. I woke up around 4:30am and took a quick shower before heading downstairs. My driver for today, Shwet (definitely spelled wrong, Khmer names are very hard to spell and pronounce for me), was the same driver who had picked me up from the airport yesterday. Waiting outside was also my tour guide, Arn (again, name definitely spelled wrong).

                As mentioned in yesterday's blog post, I woke up in the capsule hotel around 3am with only 2 hours of sleep. I laid in bed for a while trying to fall back asleep, but eventually decided to bite the bullet and get up to shower and get ready for my flight. After a refreshing shower, I made my way to the check-in area for my flight.

                I'm excited for today's flight because I will be flying in business class on a brand new airline, Saudia. Saudia is a member of the SkyTeam alliance, and I will be able to credit today's flights towards my Delta status. Additionally, I paid in cash for today's flight at a really good price: about $750 for an open jaw ticket (Dubai to Kuala Lumpur and Delhi to Dubai, both via Jeddah). This comes out to a price of 9 cents per mile flown (in BUSINESS CLASS) which is cheaper than many of the flights I had booked on this trip (in economy).

                On our final day in Dubai we planned to go out into the desert to get an authentic cultural experience by partaking in a Desert Safari. We originally planned to get lunch at a Japanese restaurant before leaving, but seeing as we were up until 5am the night before, that plan was out the window. Instead, many of us woke up around 1:30pm and ate lunch at home. Murt's housekeeper Jean had prepared some lunch for us: spaghetti bolognese and garlic bread, which was some much-needed energy before we hit the road. While we were eating, Murt's younger sister Jannat arrived home from school. Murt's mom called her out early so she could join us in the desert.

                I woke up around 9am, still tired because I had gotten used to Murt's nocturnal sleep schedule. I sat in bed on my phone until Irena barged in to wake me up around 9:30. We had agreed that we would aim to leave around 10 to drive to Abu Dhabi to visit the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque. We ended up leaving the house around 10:20, which is not too bad given our typical schedule the past few days.

                Dubai is well known for its land reclamation projects that have transformed the coastline with a series of creative (though often unfinished) projects. One of the most recognizable (and completed) projects is The Palm Jumeirah, a group of man-made islands in the shape of a palm tree. At the center of the furthest island is the luxury resort Atlantis The Palm, Dubai, home of Aquaventure Water Park, recognized in October 2022 by Guiness as having the most water slides of any water park (at 50). Murt seemed to have many positive childhood memories of going to the various water parks in Dubai, so we were eager to see if it lived up to the hype. After waking up around 11am we left the house around noon to head to Aquaventure...

                Murt is Pakistani, and today he wanted to give us the full Desi experience (Murt defines Desi as simply South Asian, South Asia being India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh). I woke up at 2:30pm since we were up so late the previous night. Around 3, Murt's housekeeper Jean helped us make breakfast, and around 5pm we finally left the house to go out for the day. This time, Murt's mom was accompanying us (and drove us!) We intended to head to Meena Bazaar, a Desi shopping area in Bur Dubai, the old part of town, but seeing that the traffic was so bad, we instead debated on where to eat as we wanted to stop for food on the way. Since all of us decided we didn't want Western food (or as Murt's mom called it, "white food"), we decided to get "brown food" instead. (it is unclear to me if "brown food" specifically means Desi/Indian/Pakistani food or if Arabic food would also be included)...

                According to my friend Murt, people in Dubai try to avoid being out during the day due to the sun and the heat. It makes sense considering the weather easily breaks 100 degrees for half of the year, although the weather today is quite comfortable. At around 72 degrees it is a beautiful day. I woke up at 11:30am but everyone else was still asleep so I hung out and worked on my blog entry for the flight to Dubai while I waited for everyone else to wake up. Finally around 1:30pm everyone was awake, although it took Mel and Irena a long time to get ready so we did not leave the house until 3:30pm...

                This blog entry picks up where the last one left off. I had just arrived at Paris Charles de Gaulle airport on a flight from Detroit. Our flight arrived at the Terminal 2E Hall M, and my flight to Dubai was scheduled to leave from Terminal 2E Hall L, so this transfer required a train ride from M to L, then a long security line. Despite having Sky Priority, there was still a considerable wait for sercurity...

                My 2023 trip began on January 6, 2023. Mom and I left the house around 6:15pm and headed to Detroit Metro Airport. Check-in was a breeze. Passengers flying Air France can check in at the standard Delta check-in counters, or at the designated Air France check-in counters, and there was no line at the latter (for Sky Priority or for general passengers). Note that the Air France counter was also staffed by Delta employees. The woman asked multiple times if I wanted to check any bags, perhaps she thinks my bag may be too large...
