        Siem Reap Part 1: Amok Time!

          As mentioned in yesterday's blog post, I woke up in the capsule hotel around 3am with only 2 hours of sleep. I laid in bed for a while trying to fall back asleep, but eventually decided to bite the bullet and get up to shower and get ready for my flight. After a refreshing shower, I made my way to the check-in area for my flight.

          KLIA2 is Air Asia's primary hub, so they control essentially the whole terminal. In front of the immigration entrance there was an airline employee making people weigh any large carry-on items. I was not sure if he would notice my backpack and stop me, and I knew it was over the 7kg limit, so I decided to check my bag to avoid this issue. When booking this flight, I pre-booked a package that included 25kg of checked luggage, a meal on the flight, and the ability to pre-select my seat. With all of this included, the total cost of my flight was still only $60. Air travel in south east Asia is very affordable!

          I made my way through immigration and into the main terminal. It was too early for any restaurants in the food court to be open. The only open restaurant was Costa coffee. The international departure section of KLIA2 has three piers: L, P, and Q gates. You go through security at the entrance of your pier. My flight departed from gate P9.

          I boarded the flight towards the end because I was assigned to zone 3, the last boarding zone. There were two Malaysian Chinese standing in my row: When I pointed to my seat they said they had been waiting for me, they didn't want to get comfortable until I came and sat down. The flight took off and food was served. They first went through the entire cabin and gave people who pre-booked meals their food. Then they went through and sold food to other passengers. Finally, they went through the cabin doing duty free sales. Needless to say, this process took up the entirety of the two hour flight. For my meal I selected nasi lemak, which is a typical Malay-style breakfast dish, and is often considered the national dish of Malaysia. It consists of coconut rice, chicken, egg, peanuts, anchovies, and sambal. It was quite delicious, though a little spicy. AirAsia claims their nasi lemak is "world famous," but since it is a relatively unknown dish that they are serving on international flights, they may win by default.

          After a short and easy flight, we landed in Siem Reap. I was not one of the first people off the plane, but was the first to make it to the immigration queue because after descending down the stairs and walking across the street, most people just stood there to either take photos of the plane we just flew in, or to wait for other members of their party. Since our plane was the only arrival at this time, our bags came off immediately, and I made it through immigration and customs in no time at all. Outside the building, I was greeted by a tuk tuk driver from Uncle Sam Villa, my hotel, who helped me carry my backpack and gave me a ride.

          Since it was only 8am, my room was not yet ready. I left my bags at the hotel, and went for a walk around the Siem Reap town. I stopped at The Source Cafe, which came highly recommended on Google Maps, for some coffee and food. I went with an iced coffee with sweet milk, and had bacon and eggs. The coffee was delicious, but I don't know why I ordered more eggs: if you're keeping track, this is my fifth breakfast in the last 24 hours, and at this point, I was feeling a little nauseous and sick of eating eggs.

          The entire meal was $7.50. Definitely not cheap by South East Asian standards, but also very affordable by American standards, especially for the quality of the food. In Cambodia, especially at places catering to tourists, prices are quoted in US Dollars, despite the Cambodian Riel being the official currency of the country. My understanding is that the Cambodian Riel is not traded on forex markets, and the dollar is so widely used, that most ATMs will only dispense US Dollars if you use a foreign card. However, US coins and $1, $2, and $5 are generally not used. Instead, for amounts less than $10, change is given in Cambodian Riel at the street rate of 4,000 KHR to 1 USD, which is only slightly worse than the official rate of 4,2000 KHR to 1 USD. For my $7.50 lunch I paid with a $10 bill and received a 10,000 KHR note in return (I was initially very confused, because the Khmer alphabet symbol for the number 1 looks exactly like a 9).

          After lunch, I walked further north towards the Angkor National Museum, where I learned a lot about the history of the Khmer people, including the kings who built Angkor Wat and the surrounding temples. I also learned a lot about the Hindu and Buddhist religions, and there were lots of interesting artifacts on display.

          After my stay at the museum, I headed back to the hotel to finish checking in. Upon arrival, the receptionist told me my room was ready and that he had already carried my bags upstairs. I took a few minutes to get settled in.

          At 12:45pm I headed down to Pub Street, a popular nightlife location located only a couple minutes walk from my hotel. A couple hours prior I called and put my name down for a cooking class at the Paper Tiger restaurant. Upon arrival, I was handed a brief subset of the menu and informed that I could pick what I wanted to learn how to cook in the cooking class. Guests can choose one starter and one main, and everyone gets the same dessert. I chose to make green mango salad with shrimp for my starter, and Amok with fish for my main.
